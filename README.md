Want downloading your mods to be a bit more convenient?

Wish the mods you download would just automatically open in penumbra?
This tool can do that with the option to disable.

Wish you could double click a mod and also have that open in penumbra?
This tool can do that, just set this as your default program.

Penumbra mod forwarder, as the name suggests, will tell penumbra to extract new mods that are downloaded to a specified folder.

4. Download mods from your favourite sites.
(Optional) 5. Install and configure TexTools at least once for mods to be automatically converted from Endwalker to Dawntrail.
